// Where the file watcher physically runs.
//
// chokidar's close() is synchronous on the calling thread and superlinear in
// watched-directory count (measured on a real tree: ~1.1s for 548 dirs, ~12s
// for 1820). Every tracked-client change rewrites the watch roots, so on the
// owning thread that teardown froze the widget for about a second per toggle.
//
// The worker is a forked child process rather than a worker thread, because a
// thread shares the owner's descriptor table. On macOS chokidar holds one
// descriptor per watched file, and once those fill every number below
// OPEN_MAX (10240) the pipes for the next child are numbered above it and
// posix_spawn rejects them: every tokscale spawn then fails with EBADF
// (issue #520). A child process keeps those descriptors, and the watcher's
// native allocations, out of the owner's process entirely.
//
// One worker at a time per coordinator. A collector restart terminates that
// worker and waits for its exit before applying the latest replacement config.
// This preserves the invariant the synchronous close used to provide — the old
// watcher is fully gone before a new one starts — while also releasing the
// worker's V8/libuv/native allocation high-water. Spawning the replacement
// before exit would overlap two descriptor sets, and on Linux the inotify budget
// is per-user and shared with editors, so the overlap could trip the exhaustion
// fallback, which is deliberately sticky for the process.
//
// unwatch() is not an alternative for incremental root edits: it stops event
// delivery but retains the descriptors (verified: 2613 fds before and after).
//
// The in-process implementation is a real fallback, not dead code. A worker can
// fail asynchronously (a missing or broken module only surfaces as 'error' and
// 'exit' after the spawn returned), and watching on this thread is worse for
// latency but still correct. It is also what the collector's watch-behaviour
// tests drive, since the reaction logic is identical on both.
