//
// A watch tick does tens of milliseconds of synchronous work after its scan
// (the exact delta, merging periods, session metadata, archive capture and
// projection), and a full scan reads transcript heads and tails synchronously
// for hundreds of milliseconds more. On the thread that owns the widget's input
// and windows that is a visible stall every few seconds while an AI client is
// writing. A usage host runs the same collector and transform on a worker
// thread instead and implements the usage runtime contract for the owner:
// tick, refreshClient, stop, whenIdle and getDiagnostics, with onUpdate,
// onPreview, onError, logger and onDiagnosticEvent called from what the worker
// reports.
//
// Summaries arrive already transformed. The worker owns the session archive as
// its writer, so the owner's own transform must not capture them again; the
// third onUpdate/onPreview argument says so.
//
// One worker at a time per coordinator. A replacement starts only after the
// previous worker has exited, so two collectors never overlap: not their scans,
// not their watcher descriptor sets (the watcher is a child process this one
// owns, killed by its collector's stop), and not their archive writes.
//
// The in-process collector is a real fallback, as in watcherHost.js. A Worker
// constructor does not throw on a broken module; it emits 'error' and exits, and
// so does a worker that crashes later. An exit nobody asked for switches this
// runtime to the in-process collector, replays the calls that were waiting on
// the worker, and keeps later runtimes in-process for the rest of the process.
//
// On by default. TOKEN_MONITOR_USAGE_WORKER=0 pins the in-process collector.
