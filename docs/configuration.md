# Configuration

Token Monitor has two configuration surfaces:

- **Widget (GUI)** — everything the desktop app does, configured from the `⚙` settings panel. This is the only surface most people need.
- **`.env`** — for the headless agent and standalone hub, which have no UI.

The widget reads `.env` values as *first-run defaults*; once you change a setting in the GUI, the saved value takes over. The agent and hub follow the precedence **CLI flag → env var (real or `.env`) → built-in default**.

## Widget (GUI)

Click the `⚙` button in the bottom-right corner of the widget to open the settings panel. Sections appear in this order:

| Section | What it controls |
|---|---|
| **General** | Language, launch at login, app updates (optionally downloaded in the background), Discord Rich Presence, About — including an on-demand redacted diagnostic report to attach to an issue — and Advanced (open the raw `settings.json` for less-common options such as `allTimeSince`). |
| **Main** | Which Home modules appear and their order, plus the display currency (USD, TWD, HKD, or CNY; daily auto rate or a manual override). |
| **Window** | Window behavior (float above other apps / normal / desktop-pinned), tray mode (macOS menu bar or Windows system tray, and what shows next to the icon), built-in or hand-built menu bar and floating-bubble layouts, hiding the taskbar/Dock icon while keeping the widget on screen, and the global show/hide shortcut. |
| **Appearance** | Interface theme (presets such as Default and Obsidian, a porcelain light mode, or custom colors), per-vendor tool colors, system glass opacity / blur (on macOS 26+, Frosted Glass or native Liquid Glass; the Edge Dock can follow it or pick its own), and separate interface and display fonts. |
| **Collection** | Tracked tools — searchable, with hide / pin / drag-reorder for the main list, per-tool source health, re-scan, and custom scan paths for sessions kept outside the defaults — collection cadence, **Keep usage from deleted sessions**, custom pricing, data export, and — on Windows — the built-in WSL scan toggle. |
| **AI Tool Limits** | Which providers to enable, their credentials and sign-in options, multiple accounts per provider (including switching the active local Codex account), session / daily / weekly / billing / credit windows (with a per-provider **Visible usage items** checklist that hides any of them from the Limits page, the Edge Dock card and the Home module), and how often to refresh (a fixed interval, or adaptive to how fast a quota is being consumed). The provider list is searchable. |
| **Subscriptions** | What you actually pay for each AI account — a recurring plan, or a top-up ledger for balance-style accounts — surfaced on hover of that account's plan label. Entered by hand; nothing is fetched from any provider. With a hub configured the list is stored on the hub and shared by every connected device; otherwise it stays in this device's `settings.json`. |
| **Multi-device Sync** | **Local only** (no hub), **Connect to a hub** (paste another machine's Hub URL + secret), **Host hub on this device** (run a hub locally; the panel lists reachable LAN / Tailscale / ZeroTier addresses), or **iCloud Drive** on macOS (opt-in, same Apple ID, no Token Monitor server). |

iCloud Drive sync is available only to the macOS widget. It stores per-device usage snapshots and per-writer subscription snapshots under `iCloud Drive/Token Monitor/sync-v1/`; updates are eventually consistent. Provider credentials and raw provider responses are excluded. If iCloud Drive is not available, the widget reports that state and retains its last-good aggregate.

Under **Multi-device Sync → Additional sync**, Node Hub and Worker connections offer default-off session titles, model aliases/grouping and custom pricing. Basic usage and cost remain part of normal sync. Titles require server permission plus a destination-specific confirmation on the sending device; hosting a Hub exposes a separate receiver-permission checkbox. Changing the saved connection, its credentials or the device ID clears the optional selections. Disabling titles requests removal from the active server store and shows pending cleanup until it succeeds.

When first enabling aliases or prices, choose the current server settings or publish this device's settings if they differ. Future edits share a server revision; a conflict asks you to reload instead of silently overwriting another device. Devices that leave an option off keep their own local settings. An older server without these endpoints continues basic sync and disables optional controls. See [privacy](privacy.md) and the [sync API](API.md#get-apisynccontent).

The `⇧` button in the title bar cycles the window behavior.

Windows portable builds can **Check for updates** through GitHub's public release page without installer metadata. Update checks follow the system proxy or explicit proxy environment. Portable builds offer the release page for manual downloads rather than automatic installation.

## Headless agent & hub (`.env`)

The agent and hub have no UI. Configure them with a `.env` file in the project root (copy it from `.env.example`):

```env
TOKEN_MONITOR_HUB_URL=               # required in sync mode — Worker URL or http://<lan-ip>:17321
TOKEN_MONITOR_SECRET=                # shared secret; must match the hub
TOKEN_MONITOR_DEVICE_ID=             # optional — defaults to the hostname
TOKEN_MONITOR_SYNC_UPLOAD_INTERVAL_MS= # optional — 0/live, 600000/10min, 1200000/20min, 1800000/30min
TOKEN_MONITOR_CLIENTS=               # optional — defaults to all supported tools; empty disables tracking
TOKEN_MONITOR_PROJECTS_ENABLED=      # optional — defaults on; 0 stops collecting project metadata
TOKEN_MONITOR_HISTORY_ENABLED=       # optional — defaults on; 0 skips trend history
TOKEN_MONITOR_SESSION_USAGE_ARCHIVE_ENABLED= # optional — defaults on; 0 stops archiving deleted-session usage
TOKEN_MONITOR_LIMITS_ENABLED=        # optional — defaults on; 0 skips CLI probing
TOKEN_MONITOR_LIMIT_PROVIDERS=       # optional — omit for all supported providers; empty probes none
TOKEN_MONITOR_LIMITS_REFRESH_MODE=   # optional — fixed (default) or adaptive
TOKEN_MONITOR_LIMITS_REFRESH_MS=     # optional — interval for fixed mode; defaults to 300000
# WorkBuddy: the desktop widget auto-detects the signed-in local app when the
# provider is enabled.
# The following are an advanced/headless-agent fallback, not normal widget setup.
# Desktop Local App monitoring is available on macOS and Windows; Linux Local
# App monitoring is unsupported. Desktop users do
# not copy a token, and Token Monitor does not store the WorkBuddy app credential.
TOKEN_MONITOR_WORKBUDDY_ACCESS_TOKEN= # headless only — explicit billing-session token
TOKEN_MONITOR_WORKBUDDY_USER_ID=      # headless only — WorkBuddy user ID
TOKEN_MONITOR_WORKBUDDY_ENTERPRISE_ID= # headless only — selects enterprise billing
TOKEN_MONITOR_WORKBUDDY_DOMAIN=      # headless only — X-Domain metadata
TOKEN_MONITOR_WORKBUDDY_DEPARTMENT_INFO= # headless only — enterprise metadata
TOKEN_MONITOR_WORKBUDDY_LOCALE=       # headless only — en or zh
```

Provider credentials (Grok, DeepSeek, Minimax, Copilot, GLM / GLM Team, Volcengine, Qoder, Command Code, WorkBuddy, Ollama, Kimi, Alibaba Token Plan, …) and proxy settings live in the same file. **`.env.example` is the complete, authoritative list** — start from it rather than copying keys by hand, since it stays in sync with the code. The desktop widget automatically reads the session owned by the local WorkBuddy app when that provider is enabled; the WorkBuddy token fields above remain only for headless/CLI deployments.

The widget reads most settings as first-run defaults. WorkBuddy follows the same provider checkbox as other auto-detected integrations on macOS and Windows; Linux local-app monitoring is unsupported. Desktop users do not copy a token, and the WorkBuddy token fields above apply only to the headless agent/CLI. The agent and hub take a CLI flag over an env var over the built-in default.

One-shot run (collect once and exit — useful for cron / launchd):

```bash
npm run agent -- --clients=claude,codex,opencode --once
```
